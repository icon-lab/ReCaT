# ReCat 

This is a collection of Matlab functions and demos to demonstrate the techniques described in the following paper:

Biyik E, Ilicak E, Çukur T. Reconstruction by calibration over tensors for multi‐coil multi‐acquisition balanced SSFP imaging. Magn Reson Med 2017. doi: 10.1002/mrm.26902.

You are encouraged to modify/distribute this code. However, please acknowledge this code and cite the paper appropriately.
This code utilizes and requires SPIRiT library and TensorLab package.


## Demos
```matlab
	demo_ReCat.m : Demonstrates the LSQR implementation of ReCat.

	demo_MLCC.m  : Demonstrates multi-linear coil compression in comparison to geometric decomposition coil compression (Zhang et. al, "Coil Compression for Accelerated Imaging with Cartesian Sampling").
```
